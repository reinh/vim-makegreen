Introduction                                       *:MakeGreen* *makegreen*
===========================================================================

MakeGreen runs |:make|. Then it shows a red/green bar in Vim's
'statusline' indicating the result.

Or put simply: "Strong Visual Indicator for Your TDD Cycle".


Requirements                                       *makegreen-requirements*
===========================================================================

This plugin requires that:

- 'compatible' isn't set.

- Your Vim is compiled with |+quickfix| and |+eval| features. You can use
  |:version| to find it out.

- One or more |:compiler| for the filetype you're working on. Vim 7.3 now
  officially ships with 51 compilers. You can search the Internet for more
  or just write your own. See |write-compiler-plugin|.


Installation                                       *makegreen-installation*
===========================================================================

Copy all files to your ~/.vim directory or use one of the following Vim
plugin managers like a decent modern Vimmist:

- pathongen: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
- Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
- NeoBundle: https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim
- VAM: https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager


Usage                                                     *makegreen-usage*
===========================================================================

Run Tests in a Single File~

Here's a quick example:

    $ cd <your rails project>
    $ vim test/unit/user_test.rb

    :compiler rubyunit
    :MakeGreen %

Expect to see a red/green bar in your 'statusline'. If the test fails,
you'll see the failure message in the red bar and the cursor would jump to
the position of the first failure.

A little explanation: the `%` character will expand to the current file
name (see |c_%|) and will be passed to the rubyunit compiler. Eventually
rubyunit just executes `testrb test/unit/user_test.rb`.

Run All Tests~

Some compiler (like rspec) runs the entire test suite if no arguments are
provided. To do that, you can just execute

    :MakeGreen

Run Any Command~

At this moment Vim doesn't propagate exit status of 'makeprg' back.
MakeGreen can't figure out if failure happens without a proper
'errorformat' being set. So if you only set 'makeprg' you'll always get
a green bar. If you have both 'makeprg' and 'errorformat' set to make it
work, you should consider distributing these two settings as a standalone
compiler :)

Selecting Compiler~

You can set compiler automatically with the following methods:

- The easiest way is set compiler per filetype. Put the following code in
  your ~/.vim/ftplugin/ruby.vim:
>
      compiler rubyunit
<
  will use rubyunit compiler for all your ruby files.

  If you prefer to have all your vim settings in a single ~/.vimrc file, just
  hook the the |FileType| autocommand event instead:
>
      autocmd FileType ruby compiler rubyunit
<

- If your test files conform to a strict naming convention, make use of it:
>
      " In ~/.vimrc
      autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *_spec.rb compiler rspec
<
  Note: the rspec compiler shipped with Vim is only works with RSpec 1.x.
  For a modern version working with RSpec 2.x, see:

  https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/blob/master/compiler/rspec.vim

- Enable Vim's 'exrc' option to set compiler project-wise. Notice that this
  introduces potential security leaks. Use with care.


Mapping                                                 *makegreen-mapping*
===========================================================================

There is no default key mapping at the moment. You can define your own
mapping easily anyway:
>
    nmap <leader>t :MakeGreen %<CR>
<
Or more conservatively:
>
    nnoremap <unique> <leader>t :MakeGreen %<CR>
<


Configuration                                     *makegreen-configuration*
===========================================================================

Options~

Set the following variable in ~/.vimrc to control the behaviour of
MakeGreen.

                                                 *g:makegreen_stay_on_file*
g:makegreen_stay_on_file    booleen (default 0)
                            If set to 1, cursor won't jump to the first
                            error when test failed.

Style~

You can configure how the red/green bar looks like with Vim's |:highlight|
command. But at this moment you have to configure it after the
plugin/makegreen.vim is loaded. You can make use of vim's |after-directory|
functionality to achieve this.

An example of ~/.vim/after/plugin/makegreen.vim looks like this:
>
    " The green bar looks pretty bright on my terminal.
    " So I have to set foreground color as black.
    hi GreenBar term=reverse ctermfg=black ctermbg=green guifg=white guibg=green
<

                                                              *hl-GreenBar*
GreenBar      default:
                term=reverse
                ctermfg=white ctermbg=green
                guifg=white guibg=green

              Style used for the green bar.

                                                                *hl-RedBar*
RedBar        default:
                term=reverse
                ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
                guifg=white guibg=red

              Style used for the red bar.

- Based on code from the rubytest.vim plugin
  (http://github.com/reinh/vim-rubytest) but considerably refactored and
  modified for this more specific purpose.

- Red/Green bar code borrowed from Gary Bernhardt
  (http://bitbucket.org/garybernhardt/dotfiles/src/tip/.vimrc) and slightly
  modified for my use. Please do check out Gary's coding videos on his blog
  for more awesome vim usage (http://blog.extracheese.org/).
